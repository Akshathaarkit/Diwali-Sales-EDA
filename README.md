# Diwali Sales Data Analysis (EDA Project)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Diwali sales dataset using Python. It aims to uncover customer buying behavior and identify sales trends based on gender, age group, state, and more.

## Objective

To analyze sales data from a Diwali shopping season and draw useful business insights using data visualization and aggregation techniques.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas – for data cleaning and analysis
- NumPy – for numerical operations
- Seaborn & Matplotlib – for creating charts and graphs
- Jupyter Notebook – for interactive coding

## Dataset Info

- The dataset includes columns like:
  - Gender, Age Group, State, Orders, Amount, etc.
- Data cleaning steps:
  - Removed null values
  - Dropped unnecessary columns
  - Converted data types

## Key Insights

- Compared total sales by gender
- Analyzed age group vs. purchase behavior
- Identified top 10 states by total orders and sales
- Used bar charts with labels for better visual understanding

## Example Charts

- Gender-wise purchase count
- Sales distribution across states
- Age group and gender comparisons

All visualizations are generated using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
